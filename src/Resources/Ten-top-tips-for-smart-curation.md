      <a class="item"><span class="bold-notchup">Know your audience </span>-  Take time to look at your audience demographics and interests and see who engages with your content. Look for factors that can help you curate even better.</a>
      <a class="item"><span class="bold-notchup">Respond to your audience </span>- Just because you haven't created what you've shared doesn't stop you engaging with audience comments, and here you can really show your personality and help build your page brand</a>
      <a class="item"><span class="bold-notchup">Look at the numbers </span>-  There's no end to the amount of analytics data you have to pour over, but understand the numbers and you are more likely to succeed because you will see what works, and what doesn't.</a>
