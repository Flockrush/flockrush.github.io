  <h2>How to choose images primed for social engagement
  </h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>When you are looking for high volumes of content it’s really important never to forget that the quality of your content is the foundation of your audience growth. As with all your content, you should select images for performance and learn how they
      can influence the success of your fan page through the behaviour of your audience. </p>
  <p>Here are five tips to help you be more successful at the end, by beginning with the right content. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
    Tip One: Be relevant
  </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>It sounds obvious but you have to be relevant to your fan page – not just in terms of the subject, but the tone and personality of images have to align closely with that of your page. If the pull of your page is entertaining animals, they you have
      to post genuinely entertaining animals or you will struggle to hold the interest of your fans. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
    Tip Two: Be Noticeable
  </h3>
  <p>Your posts need to stand out to get noticed. MIT research showed the human brain can process entire images in just 13 milliseconds – and can then move on – so you don’t have much time to capture interest. </p>
  <p>Look for images with brighter colors and clear subjects to make it easier to break through the noise of all the other posts vying for attention. </p>
  <p>You need to convey your story quickly. Use images that will allow you to do that effectively with space for any text you want to add, using your own experience to decide whether there’s a natural or clear story you can tell. </p>
  <p>You should also look at the whole picture – be careful to check there are no hidden nasties or anything that could be misinterpreted as anything negative in the image. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
    Tip Four: Get Emotional
  </h3>
  <p>If you can deliver a story that connects with positive emotions then your engagement will be much better. By selecting images that lend themselves to an emotional tagline, or call to action, then your job in curating content becomes much easier. </p>
  <p>Look at the reactions posts are getting to understand what pulls heart-strings and drives fan engagement. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
    Tip Five: Be Sharable
  </h3>
  <p>Choose images fans will want to share – something that has broad appeal and a strong emotional connection is the ideal combination. Look at the history of your content performance for shares and think about why it worked. Did it tap into a particular
      niche, such as a particular animal breed, or was it something with broad appeal like humour. </p>
