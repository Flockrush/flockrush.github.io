  <h2>What you need to know about User-Generated Content rights approval</h2>
  <p>The draw of using User-Generated Content (UGC) for your social posts is strong – an almost endless supply of ‘free’ content that can transform your success in growing fans on social. It’s a key part of the
    <a href="/resources/How-to-build-an-audience-of-one-million-fans-in-ten-steps/">Flockrush strategy </a>  – using content to build fan page audiences - and one the reason why it’s possible to build a one million strong fan page with 2-3 hours work a day.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Why is UGC approval important?</h3>
  <p>
    Brands have long used UGC to support their online and social strategies. It brings authenticity, it’s low (or no) cost and it is generally more trusted than brand produced content.</p>
  <p>
    The “User” part of UGC shouldn’t be forgotten, someone somewhere created that content and that person has certain rights over it. When anyone takes user-generated content, particularly for commercial reasons, and doesn’t seek the permission of the content
    owner prior to publication then the door is open to challenges, even legal ones.</p>
  <p>
    In reality few UGC cases end up in court, but even at a lower level the consequences can be severe for fan page owners. Repeated complaints about pages abusing UGC can lead to pages and accounts being suspended or deleted, resulting in a loss of audience,
    traffic generations and potential revenue.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">How can you use Flockrush to protect yourself against claims from UGC owners?</h3>
  <p>
    Flockrush makes discovering lots of user—generated content very easy, so getting approval from content owners whose content you want to publish on your fan page needed an equally efficient way to get and track usage approval.</p>
  <p>
    When you find content you want to use, a single click notifies the source that you would like to use their image. They will have a link to your usage terms and conditions and a simple click to authorize.</p>
  <p>
    This instantly gives you an approval paper-trail that, in the event of any future questions about legitimacy, can be used to demonstrate the approval you have been given.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">How do I track UCG approvals?</h3>
  <p>
    There are two routes to managing approved content. Once approved you can have the post featuring the UCG content held in a bank of approved posts waiting for you to add to your content queues, or you can set the post to automatically be added to content
    cues on approval.</p>
  <p>
    For Flockrush users this means that tracking isn’t even needed – with just one click to request approval no further action is necessary above and beyond you regular content publishing process.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">How Can I Increase My Chances of Approval?</h3>
  <p>
    When you request approval a comment will be sent to the post, tagging the account name that posted it. We recommend. A short message that complements the post, or the person who posted it, a mention of the page you want to feature it on and a link to
    the authorisation page. </p>
  <p>
    We recommend that you use a number or similar messages – you don’t have to completely personalize every request, but if you post the same message hundreds, or even thousands of times you can find yourself considered a spammer. Using multiple messages
    also allows you to A/B test your approach as refine your messages.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">What happens if the content owner doesn’t give authorization?</h3>
  <p>
    In our experience most content owners are happy to have their content used if you’ve taken the trouble to ask, but of course sometimes they may not be – especially if content contains images of people they don’t want used by third parties – and sometimes
    they may just not respond.</p>
  <p>
    Once you request approval nothing will happen with the post featuring the relevant UGC until a positive approval is received, you remove the approval request or you remove the post.</p>
  <p>
    You can’t expect every request to be approved, but because Flockrush makes it so easy to find and curate content a scale you can have numbers on your side – curating enough posts that ensures you can still hit your publishing rates to grow your fan page
    audience.</p>
  <p>
    Using UGC is a great way to build a large amount of content that you can use for fan page audience growth. Using the tools built into Flockrush you can do this and be confident your fan pages are safe from claims of plagiarising content – leaving you
    to focus on making your pages engaging enough to build your audience successfully.</p>
