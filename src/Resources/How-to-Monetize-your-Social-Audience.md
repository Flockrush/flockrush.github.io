  <h3 class="ui header">What is monetization? </h3>
  <p>
      Monetization is something lots of people are talking about in relation to audiences, but what actually is this? Ultimately we’re talking about delivering something of monetary value from your fan page followers, but there are many ways to achieve this
      depending on why you built it.</p>
  <p>
      The value in your audience lies in the combination of their relevance and scale. All audiences are not created equally – to build the greatest value you need to build them around a strong target audience to make them relevant to your purpose. </p>
  <p>
      Flockrush, our fan page audience building platform, uses content to build engaged social audience fan pages around a target market and uses them to help you deliver on a number of marketing objectives. </p>
  <p>
      For brands and agencies this can be generating sustained targeted traffic at scale for your website, store, app, or anywhere you need it. It can also mean capturing high volumes of email addresses from for outbound promotional CRM. </p>
  <p>
      For individuals and agencies this may be much more direct monetization, selling space on your blog such as through Adsense and other space sponsorship opportunities. </p>
  <p>
      All of these have value – you just need to decide on which approach suits you.
