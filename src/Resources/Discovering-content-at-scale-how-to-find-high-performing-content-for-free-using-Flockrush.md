    Discoving content at scale - how to find high performing content for free using Flockrush
  </h2>
  <h3 class="ui header">
    Why discovering content at scale is key to growing fan page communities
  </h3>
  <p>It’s a well-known adage that ‘Content is King’, which applies to social in a big way, but good content can also be expensive to produce. It’s something brands struggle to do well, and very few have mastered the ability to produce
      a consistent level of high quality content that gets high engagement.
  </p>
  <p>Our strategy (LINK TO FLOCKRUSH STRATEGY DOC) is different, with Flockrush you can:
  </p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Access millions of pieces of high quality content
      </li><li>See how content has already performed on social
      </li><li>Select multiple pieces of content simultaneously for curation and publishing
      </li><li>Remove the hassle of having to add content to your publishing platform
      </li></ul>
  <p>Imagine a page with 1,000,000 followers. If each post gets 1-2% reach that’s an audience of 10k-20k people. So posting once a day will have a relatively small reach. Post 10 times a day and suddenly you have a potential follower reach 10 times as
      big – and that scales up. This is a very simplistic view, but one that demonstrates why the Flockrush strategy works – few brands will post highly engaging content 10 times or more a day, but by curating content around a topic of high
      interest you can do what big brands can’t, and for a fraction of the cost.
  </p>
  <p>With organic post reach often low single figures, and reducing, the ability to achieve audience reach organically requires high volume posting. Growing large audiences with Flockrush on high interest topics needs as much as hourly posting – equating
      to some 168 posts a week, or nearly 9,000 posts a year.
  </p>
  <p>Creating that volume of original content from scratch would be highly cost prohibitive, and require many thousands of hours to get it created and published.
  </p>
  <p>Flockrush is built to help you find high performance content that you can quickly curate at a very large scale.

  </p>

      </li><li>News from Google. &nbsp;
      </li></ul>
