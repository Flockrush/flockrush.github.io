  <h2>Why your fan page audience needs a Flockrush blog</h2>
  <p>Your Flockrush blog is the bridge to take traffic generated from your social fan pages and deliver it against your marketing objectives, whether that’s sending that traffic to your brand site, collecting subscription email addresses or generating revenue
  from selling the advertising potential.</p>
  <p>
  Flockrush makes it look easy – taking away all the hassle of managing a hosted blog, with all its security patching, performance and optimization requirements. On top of that the Flockrush uses state of the art software to deliver the level of performance
  normally reserved for multi-million dollar budget sites such as high traffic international news outlets.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header">How does blogging fit into the Flockrush strategy?
</h3>
  <p>The core strategy sees you building an audience around a broad topic of high interest. To transition people from the social environment to one that you control needs two things – a balance of unlinked posts where users remain on the social site and linked
  posts where users clicking on the posts can be taken to landing page that’s yours. </p>
  <p>
  Getting the balance is crucial – too many linked posts taking traffic out of the native social environment and you won’t find your pages recommended, but too few and you won’t be maximising your traffic potential. In our experience, if you are posting
  hourly then linking every sixth post to your blog is a good balance.</p>
  <p>
  Where you link traffic to also has to mirror your fan page topic – when you post a picture of a cute pet on Facebook you can’t then just link that to an unrelated page jfic you generate. It’s the home for all your content but carefully managed to promote
  two key tools just because you want the traffic there. Sooner or later your page will be penalized, potentially severely (such as with account suspension).</p>
  <p>
  Your blog is where you realize the value of the traffic.</p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Email subscription – integrated with Mailchimp to support email marketing campaigns</li><li>
    Promotional space – integrated with Google Adsense allowing you to monetize pages through the Google ad network or by working directly with brands</li></ul>
  <p>
Having an effective blog is therefore the centerpiece of realising the value of the audience you have created. </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Why your fan page audience needs a Flockrush blog
</h3>
  <p>The benefits of a Flockrush blog fall into four core areas:</p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Increase engagement by surfacing best performing personalized content</li><li>
    Get increased performance – both speed (supporting SEO) and security</li><li>
    Seamless integration with your fan page content to remove time and effort in posting to your blog</li><li>
    Built-in monetization with support for Adsense</li><li>Eliminate hosting and support costs for your blog</li></ul>
  <p>What this means is that whereas managing a typical blog getting high traffic volumes needs both platform resource to support it and content resource to add and manage content. With Flockrush all you need to be concerned with is how what you want to do
  with the traffic you’ve generated.</p>
  <p>
  Flockrush is integrated with both Cxense for user insights, segmentation and content personalization, and Disqus, principally for audience moderation.</p>
  <p>
  And by the way, if you want to use WordPress that’s fine also – we integrate with that using the JetPack plugin. Flockrush users who have used WordPress often migrate to our blog platform because of the benefits it offers so if you would like a full demonstration
