  <p>Flockrush is a Marketing Technology Company.</p>
  <p>Built around a key insight to leverage the full scope of social media and drive enviable traffic, build big audiences and email lists. Here is a brief <a href="/An-Introduction-to-Flockrush/">introduction to Flockrush.</a></p>
  <p>It’s tough getting your message out there and be noticed, against a wall of marketing noise. Like many start-ups, we needed to make a limited marketing budget punch well above its weight, and that’s how Flockrush was born. We discovered that we could drive insane traffic and build audiences to market to audiences that wouldn’t vanish overnight, and traffic and audiences that could be highly targeted. Using content to tell stories and distribute content effectively works, but the tools available made this harder work than made sense to us.
        </p>
  <p>And so our inspiration came from murmuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4f_1_r80RY&amp;list=PLSw6GbeodJHTBj9mcumqabq5O8lpZFggN&amp;index=1">flocks of starlings</a>. One of nature’s great shows. Just like audiences, no flock is static – it's movement is governed by the influence of those around them. When something gets the attention of the edge of the flock it cascades through the group as a visible wave. We knew if we could help people create waves through content, then they too would get noticed by their audience. The Flockrush team set out to do something well that no one else has. The result is the single best platform for mass discovery, curation and distribution of content, at scale, for social media channels and blogs.
        </p>
  <p>
            For the first time, it is possible to do what Flockrush excels at in one platform, for entire teams. Following content 'from cradle to grave' in one place is saving content teams massive amounts of time in itself, but with the features we've built to support content curation and publishing across all social channels simultaneously, new ways of working for large and small teams are now possible.
        </p>
  <p>Our AI technology supports our cloud-based SaaS platform giving you access to your projects wherever you want to be, always using the latest software release and running with telco-grade reliability.
        </p>
  <p>But we're never satisfied - our success only comes when yours does - so we're always working to make better and new ways to support you in achieving your marketing goals whatever it takes.
        </p>
  <p>For building your traffic, audiences and growing email lists, there really is nothing better.
