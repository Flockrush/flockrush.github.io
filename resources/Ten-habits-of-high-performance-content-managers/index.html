  <h2>Ten habits of high performance content managers</h2>
  <p>Maintaining the quality of your content is critical to success. The Flockrush strategy of discovering, curating and publishing at scale generates high volumes of content, with queues of potentially thousands of posts to manage. Pruning the content
      in those queues to take out underperforming posts is an essential part of sustaining high performance, as is finding new ideas.</p>
  <p>
      It may sound daunting at first, but Flockrush makes the process of managing content queues really easy, and there are habits you can develop a really effective approach.</p>
  <h3 id="habitone" class="green">Habit One: Think about the role of your content overall</h3>
  <p>
      It’s very easy to go head-first into micro management of posts, but think first about the what your content should be doing to achieve the aims of your fan page and whether you are starting with good content and effectively curating it. If you aren’t
      doing this well then all pruning will do is reduce your content.</p>
  <h3 id="habittwo" class="green">Habit Two: Check data trends frequently and nip poor performance in the bud
    </h3>
  <p>You have to know the data and insights behind your pages – frequently checking your high level performance will show you the trends and blips to help you zero in on where you need to focus. If you have positive performance trends but a dip in performance
      this could be down to a small number of posts, and your pruning job is simple. If you start to see very mixed performance, or even negative trends you need to get to this quickly. Checking your performance data regularly will stop issues accumulating.</p>
  <h3 id="habitthree" class="green">Habit Three: Monitor performance at post level to learn what good looks like
    </h3>
  <p>We said knowing your insights was important at a high level, but this needs to me matched by looking at the good, the bad and the ugly of your posts to build a mental understanding of what good looks like. There’s only do far data can help you understand
      what is a visual medium. Get in the habit of reviewing your posts daily and not only will you be able to stay on top of pruning, but it will also help you with how you create your future content.</p>
  <h3 id="habitfour" class="green">Habit Four: Polarize your view on content
    </h3>
  <p>Whilst content isn’t all good or all bad, to effectively manage large volumes of data you need to quickly build a view on just that or you could spend a lot of time on sorting out the average performers. To help you can view content as good enough
      to recycle and use again or not – and if not you remove it from the queue. Taking this mind-set helps you to focus on great and should quickly help you see the whole process as one making each stage deliver high performance.</p>
  <h3 id="habitfive" class="green">Habit Five: Fix the quick content fixes
    </h3>
  <p>Removing underperforming content from queues is good practice to maintain high performance, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you need to bin it altogether. When you see a post that isn’t performing at a high level consider if a small change could
      significantly change its fortunes. Maybe even just editing a single word can make the difference and build a more instinctive approach to better curation.</p>
  <h3 id="habitsix" class="green">Habit Six: Look at the negatives
    </h3>
  <p>Removing underperforming content builds your performance – looking at why builds your knowledge. When you’re pruning content take the time to look at what it performed badly – what negative reactions did it get and what could have led to that. Did
      the post prompt people to hide all posts, was there sadness or anger? People want to be entertained so making the time to check and understand the negatives will be another step in making you a master curator.</p>
  <h3 id="habitseven" class="green">Habit Seven: Read comments
    </h3>
  <p>One of you greatest sources of information can come simply from the comments people make on your page. This is something that you can do anywhere – with just a couple of minutes downtime and it’s easy to dip into your page comments and see what your
      fans are saying. You’ll understand them better, and with that understanding deliver them (and yourself) better results. </p>
  <h3 id="habiteight" class="green">Habit Eight: Try new things and push the boundaries (with care!)
    </h3>
  <p>There’s a careful balance between doing more of what works and trying new things to discover new, and better, approaches. When managing your fan pages you can be more successful by looking for new things to try, and new ways to connect with your audience.
      Large audiences won’t change overnight, but social media product and source of change and innovation. Building a routine of trying new ideas into your program can help you uncover new ways to build your audience.</p>
  <h3 id="habitnine" class="green">Habit Nine: Look again, and again, at what works on other pages
    </h3>
  <p>In topic discovery you may have looked at what was working on other pages to help build your strategy. But why stop there? Making time to go back regularly and check what other audience building pages are doing and, critically, being able to see what’s
      working can help you discover new ideas for your own pages. Don’t limit yourself to similar pages – ideas can be found everywhere, whether that’s new ideas to move forward, or fixes to challenges you may already have. If you’re too absorbed in your
      own audience building bubble you could be missing out.</p>
  <h3 id="habitten" class="green">Habit Ten: Make managing your content habitual!
    </h3>
  <p>OK, so this maybe obvious, but making the process of managing your content a habit in itself is an essential part of developing your page performance. You have to make time for it, and also make that time count. With the other nine habits though we
      hope we have helped make this easier for you – and in doing so helped you on your path to building your first, or next, million fans faster than ever.</p>
