      How to use a blog to monetizing your fan page </h2>
  <p>
      The Flockrush strategy helps you to use content to build large, targeted fan pages based around a topic that resonates with the audience you want. As soon as you are creating traffic you have an asset that you can monetize. But how do you do that? </p>
  <p>
      With Flockrush we help you do this with a blog from our own blogging platform that is linked to your fan page as part of your Flockrush plan. This is the simplest way to direct traffic from your social fan pages to land where you can control monetization.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Why your blog is important</h3>
  <p>
      Using topic based content to build a large audience is a key part of our strategy, but having fans only engaging with a fan page doesn’t enable you to monetize them – your content posting has to consistently supply content based that fits your page. To
      be able to serve alternative content, such as ads, you need to capture the traffic your fan pages create and land it somewhere you have full content control.</p>
  <p>
      This is where your work pays off – literally. Having targeted audiences you are now able to route around 20% of your organic posts to a link to your blog. In parallel you are also promoting all your posts to new audience targets.</p>
  <p>
      When you receive blog traffic you have the opportunity to capture email subscribers of those who love your content – more on why that’s important below.</p>
  <p>
      So you now have a blog page where you can fully manage your own content, and an email list that you can build and contact. You are now primed to start monetizing!
    </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Why Flockrush created their own blog platform</h3>
  <p>
      It would be have been easy to just integrate with some third party blogging platforms – and indeed we do integrate with Wordpress via the Jetpack pluging. We built out own platform for four main reasons:
    </p>

  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">
            Managing your own blog is far more resource consuming than many people realise when they start getting into serious blog solutions – managing an ongoing ending process of security updates, performance optimization, SEO etc.</a>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">
  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">
            To achieve performance at scale needed a purpose built solution that made it easy for Flockrush users to have the performance of a high traffic site without any specialist support</a>

            We can ensure compliance with Adsense policies and give you complete control of managing content on your Flockrush blog however you choose to monetize it</a>

            Every process works end to end all within one platform – all content management and analytics are built into Flockrush for fan pages and blogs</a>

  <p>Flockrush blogs we use the latest JAMstack architecture to ensure that your pages load lightening fast - you can test a live blog

      <a href="http://www.puppydogcrush.com/">(www.puppydigcrush.com) </a>  here.</p>
  <p>
      Flockrush blogs give you the level of performance that big news sites spend millions of dollars trying to achieve and maintain – without having any site maintenance costs outside your Flockrush plan. Clients often come to us expecting to use a third party
      blogging solution, but once they see the performance we achieve with zero site maintenance for themselves they are quick to convert.</p>
  <p>
      When you create your content for publishing to your fan pages we also make it very easy to add that to your blog – it’s no different than adding another publishing channel – so you simply add Blog to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other social channel
      you post to. It really couldn’t be any easier.
    </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Selling advertising space via Adsense</h3>
  <p>
      If you want to sell space on your Flockrush blog to advertisers via Google Adsense then this is very simple to do. You can integrate your Adsense account with your Flockrush blog using pre-built templates designed to optimise the mix of space between
      your content and advertiser content.</p>
  <p>
      Our templates are designed to be fully compliant with Google Adsense policies so you can focus on maximising your revenue.</p>
  <p>
      This allows you to use all the features of Adsense
      <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start">(find out more here) </a>  as well as all the benefits of your Flockrush blog with minimal hassle.</p>
  <p>
      This is possible the simplest way to monetize your audience 24/7 leaving you to decide how much time you want to spend optimizing your Adsense revenue.
    </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Building fan pages for brand audiences</h3>
  <p>
      The full power of Flockrush lies in building audiences around target profiles. This means that audiences can be built around brand profiles in order to be used as a traffic engine. Whether that traffic is exposed exclusively to brand marketing campaigns,
      or more directly delivered to a website, for example, it has a value.</p>
  <p>
      This approach can be used by agencies to develop traffic engines for clients, or by brands themselves looking for a more cost effective way to build targeted traffic than their normal PPC and display campaigns.</p>
  <p>
      With the flexibility of Flockrush you can combine brand activity with Adsense to ensure that there’s never a moment when your blog isn’t delivering you revenue from traffic.
    </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Collecting email subscriptions</h3>
  <p>
      Built in to all our Flockrush blogs is the ability for visitors to subscribe via email. Having a database of email addresses is a great marketing tool. Whilst visitors have subscribed because of the content in your blog, you are able to add advertising/marketing
      messages to your emails to further monetize your audience.</p>
  <p>
      Flockrush integrates with MailChimp allowing you to collect emails through Flockrush and use them with MailChimp, exploiting the features of their specialist email marketing platform.</p>
  <p>
      Using Flockrush it’s possible to build not just large fan page audiences, but also large email databases. Following good practice about how frequently you broadcast emails and what you put in them you have a tool that you can switch on traffic very effectively,
      without relying on visitors to come to you.</p>
  <p>
      Your blog is a fundamental part of the Flockrush strategy. We help you set up a Blog with no need for any specialist technical resource, and to monetize it simply though integrating with partners that enable you to work at scale, no matter how large your
      audience.
    </p>
  <p>
      However you choose to monetize your blog, Flockrush gives you the options to do it with the minimum of hassle. For individuals, agencies and brands, Flockrush lets you deploy the strategy that fits your marketing objectives best, integrating with partners
      allow you to monetize your blog effectively.</p>
