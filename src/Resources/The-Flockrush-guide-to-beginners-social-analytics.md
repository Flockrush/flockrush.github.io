      and cutting out what doesn’t.</p>
  <p>

        Understanding what’s important</h3>
  <p>
        There are a common set of measures for social fan page analytics – the choice to make is how much you want to measure and how deeply. Before you start diving head first into data, reports and insights, it’s important to understand what the priority is
        for your page and how you work.</p>
  <p>
        Every report you create should have a “so what” test – does analysing the data give you an outcome against your strategy? That outcome might be that no change is needed in your approach, but to get the best out of your time analysing having a clear view
        of the relationships between the various metrics is important. You want your reports to help you achieve good fan page growth, quickly and clearly.</p>
  <p>
        For Flockrush users, audience growth and engagement will be critical – if your audience isn’t growing and your content isn’t engaging then this will need urgent attention. Other social metrics will help you to understand why this may be the case as you
        dive into the data.
      </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
        How much time do I need to spend on analytics?</h3>
  <p>
        There is no right answer to how much time you need to spend on data, but the better you understand your content and audience engagement the more chance you have of making your pages succeed quickly.</p>
  <p>
        In our post
        <u>Ten habits of high performance content managers</u> analytics was featured as an area that you should create a habit out of – ideally being able to spend a little time daily, or at least frequently, looking though the most recent data. This is
        because you need to be able to react as quickly as possible to any issues that might harm your audience building objectives. </p>
  <p>
        If you have a post that has created a very negative response in fan sentiment then in extreme cases you may need to remove it quickly to avoid a drop or slow-down in your daily net fan growth. This can be done either by looking at post insights, or by
        making use of our streaming analytics widgets to track engagement in real-time, as it happens. </p>
  <p>
        Seeing your data in real-time is a really useful way to set up analytics allowing you to see at a glance the moment something takes off or falls down.</p>
  <p>
        For more strategic analysis you should be taking a look at least weekly at your overall numbers to see if you are achieving the levels of growth and engagement you expect from your content strategy.
      </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
        Building your reports</h3>
  <p>
        Flockrush has highly versatile analytics dashboards built in. Dashboards can be configured to show you the data almost any way you need it - allowing you to select a dashboard template layout and then populate it with the data ‘widgets’ you want.</p>
  <p>
        Your reports aren’t intended to give you everything you’ll ever need to know – their role is to tell you if you are heading in the right direction, and where to look for more detail if you aren’t. Your reports are building insights on your page, such
        as:</p>
  <div class="ui ordered list p-light-up">
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">
  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">
              Follower numbers</a>
  <div class="description"> Are you achieving the level of fans you expected – and is your rate of growth accelerating or slowing?</div>

  <div class="content">

              Post Reach</a>

  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">
              Engagement rates per post</a>

</div>
</div>
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">
  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">
              Sentiment analysis</a>
  <div class="description"> What is the sentiment towards your pages – are you generating too much negativity with your content, potentially impacting growth</div>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">

            </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
  <p>
        You can track multiple pages or channels in reports too so it’s possible to keep an eye on everything you’re managing in one set of reports.</p>
  <p>
        When you have set up your reports you can schedule these to be emailed to you and your team as frequently as you like to help ensure that including analysis of your pages becomes habitual and leads to improvements in your content strategy.
      </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
        Getting into the detail</h3>
  <p>
        Once you have a good set of dashboards set up you will start to become familiar with performance patterns and will start to learn to spot areas that need investigation. Use your daily and weekly performance reviews to spot the peaks, troughs and trends.
        Using these signals, your can then look at shorter periods in isolation to review the publishing or engagement that is driving the high level results.</p>
  <p>
        Beware of averages though. Averages will always hide insights – if you have a very high performing post and a very low performing post knowing that your performance across the two is average isn’t helpful. You need to understand where good performance
        is masking poor performance to maximise your page performance.
