  <h2>Audience building by numbers - using analytics to grow your fan pages</h2>
  <p>
  Flockrush contains a wealth of analytics reporting, powerfully presented through highly customizable dashboards that you can use to support your audience growth strategy.</p>
  <p>
  You need analytics for three reasons</p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>What’s past – how have you performed over time, what has worked, what hasn’t?</li><li>
    Where are you now – are you on track with your KPIs?</li><li>
    Does the future need to change - what should you to develop your audience in the future?</li></ul>
  <p>Everyone has different needs for data and insights and so Flockrush helps you in a number of ways, supporting the level you want to work at.</p>
  <p>
  If you want to configure analytics dashboards and stream real-time data to watch your page minute-by-minute as posts are published you can do that. If you prefer the lighter touch of just knowing which of your content is good and which is not then this
  can be done in a highly accessible way.
</p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Analyzing your past performance</h3>
  <p>
  Understanding your past performance can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your future efforts. Knowing what worked well, and what didn’t work well can be used to great effect. As your fan numbers grow the dynamics of your analytics may
  change, but as the numbers grow more stable patterns should begin to emerge.</p>
  <p>
  At the most basic level you need to be able to identify the performance of your content so you can manage it. You can do this really easily within the queue management tool – sorting your content by performance to enable you to promote the good and delete
  the bad.</p>
  <p>
  Flockrush features artificial intelligence supported AI so you can also see the sentiment of your engagement – are your fans getting more or less positive about your posts? Where are you gaining fans, where are you leaking fans? </p>
  <p>
  Our dashboards can be set up to show you how your pages have grown by time, channel or country to allow you to enable you to analyze your performance. These can be scheduled to be emailed to you so numbers can be accessible to you daily, weekly or monthly
  wherever you are.
</p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Using analytics to know when to adjust strategy</h3>
  <p>
  Knowing where you are is the bridge to looking at past performance and deciding on your future direction. </p>
  <p>
  The single biggest value in analytics is to know when you need to adjust your strategy. The Flockrush strategy sets out guidelines for fan page audience building, but within that is a wide range of decisions you can take to influence the rate you grow
  and the way you do it.</p>
  <p>
  The fundamental questions to ask are:</p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Is my content working – do I need to change the type or style of curation?</li><li>
    Am I growing fans fast enough, and am I keeping them?</li><li>
    Are my fans engaging?</li><li>
    Am I converting fans into my objectives (such as website traffic, email subscriptions and sales)</li></ul>
  <p></p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Is my content working?</h3>
  <p>
  Content is the fundamental driver of your success – if it’s not working then you need to address this as soon as possible. In our experience it’s rare that all content is either good or bad – there’s spectrum – and this can help you to get to the bottom
  of your content strategy. Content performance dashboards will show you the numbers driving performance and are an ideal way to spot trends and patterns. But always reference the data to your content - with visual content it’s always harder to get the
  full picture from analytics and you can easily miss obvious factors. </p>
  <p>
  Look at the styles of the posts that are working best, what do they feature, what is the context and story, what makes it likeable? Contrast this with the poorer performers – is there anything noticeably different, such as unreadable fonts or different
  features. </p>
  <p>
  When you understand what’s working best and do more of it you will notice the difference in your page performance. </p>
  <p>
  When you use a Flockrush blog you can see the full perspective of analysis from post analytics for your content though to converting fans to do what you set out to achieve. You can find out all about
