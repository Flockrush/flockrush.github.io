    Why content curation beats content creation for audience building
  </h2>
  <p><i>and how Flockrush makes it possible.</i></p>
  <p>Creating a content strategy to grow your audience can be a daunting prospect. The time and cost of creating a constant stream of high performing original content that gets noticed, against high numbers of competing publishers, can be prohibitive for many.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-will-your-audience-actually-see-your-content-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-will-your-audience-actually-see-your-content-"><span></span></a>
    Will your audience actually see your content?
  </h3>
  <p>But for those who invest in large scale original content creation there&apos;s a real sting in the tail. As social networks mature, feed algorithms make it perennially harder for brands to reach their own audience. Research by social@Ogilvy showed this has
      declined steadily year after year - now sitting below 2%, and still falling.
  </p>
  <p><img class="ui fluid image" src="/img/Organic-Reach-Chart.png" alt="Ogilvy  Facebook Organic Reach Report"></p>
  <p>So how do you create a content strategy that allows you to create and sustain an engaged audience and get your marketing messages across? One option is to spend money to promote your content - buying visibility - but another approach that uses user-generated
      content can deliver more effective results.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-the-opportunity-of-user-generated-content-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-the-opportunity-of-user-generated-content-"><span></span></a>
    The opportunity of user-generated content
  </h3>
  <p>User-generated content (UGC) offers access to content at far lower cost than original content and with more assured results. Unlike content you create, with UGC you can see how content is performing before you use it, so the ROI can be increased while
      at the same time the risk of poor performance decreases. Flockrush makes the opportunity of using UCG possible at a level no other platform can match.
  </p>
  <p>You can find out more on the strategy of
      <a href="/resources/How-to-build-an-audience-of-one-million-fans-in-ten-steps">Flockrush here </a> - we help you to create audiences around a topic that appeals to your target market, even if that topic appears disconnected from your product, service
      or brand. This audience can then be funnelled via blogs towards your marketing campaigns, helping you to activate your messages to a highly targeted group.
  </p>
  <p>The key to using content to build an audience is scale. With less than 2% reach you need a lot of content to gain visibility. But this can be viewed as an opportunity - you can recycle your high performing content many times safe in the knowledge that
      it won&apos;t be seen by the same people time and time again.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-how-to-build-your-content-strategy-around-curating-ugc-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-how-to-build-your-content-strategy-around-curating-ugc-"><span></span></a>
    How to build your content strategy around curating UGC
  </h3>
  <p>UGC gives you the volume of base content, but to really make it perform curation is everything. Don&apos;t think of UGC as the solution, but a key ingredient in a special formula. Enhancing UGC allows you to take high performing content and personalize it
      with your own tone and style.
  </p>
  <p>Consider a cute pet photo - a picture may say a thousand words, but sometimes just a few more are enough to make it tell a story. This example here shows how a good picture becomes great content to tell a great story:
  </p>
  <p>INSERT RAW PICTURE [UGC BEFORE CURATION]
  </p>
  <p>INSERT RAW PICTURE WITH CURATION [UGC AFTER CURATION]
  </p>
  <p>The ability to curate well is the key to making a high performance, but low cost, content strategy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-curating-content-at-scale-gets-results-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-curating-content-at-scale-gets-results-"><span></span></a>
    Curating content at scale gets results
  </h3>
  <p>When you can curate effectively at scale you can start the journey of audience building, but before you can curate you need to discover your content.
  </p>
  <p>Within Flockrush you can set up all your content sources and search the vast pools of content across Getty, Twitter and Instagram to give you results that you can select with a single click, enabling you to find all the images and videos you need quickly
      and efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>INSERT SCREEN SHOT
  </p>
  <p>Your raw UGC library can be curated across all your channels, simultaneously. Whether you are adding commentary, or editing the image to make a meme, it can all be done in Flockrush - enabling you to get from discovery, through curation and to publish
      scheduling under a minute.
  </p>
  <p>Creating content queues that are large enough to enable you to post multiple times a day gives you the ability to reach a much higher percentage of your audience than posting brand content once or twice a day.
  </p>
  <p>Working at scale in this way allows you to publish very high volumes of content, giving you the opportunity to gain comparatively high reach, engagement and subscription rates.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-content-quality-is-as-important-and-quantity-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-content-quality-is-as-important-and-quantity-"><span></span></a>
    Content quality is as important and quantity
  </h3>
  <p>Curation is as much art as science. You can apply lots of rules to curating posts, but even seasoned content curators cannot guarantee how any post will perform. When you have curated high volumes of content it&apos;s important to manage it to maintain quality.
      Removing the poor performing posts is at least every bit as important as recycling the best performing content.
  </p>
  <p>Flockrush makes this process easy. With queue sorting by post performance you can quickly eject the content that is detrimental to your audience building goals and recycle or promote the highest performing.
  </p>
  <p>INSERT SCREEN SHOT
  </p>
  <p>This content pruning achieves results on two fronts - firstly you will be more likely to grow subscribers quickly because the content being seen is a better quality and secondly your social pages will be seen by their host social channels as high performers
      and be more likely to show in content feeds.
  </p>
  <p>This compound effect is fundamental to the success of any page - we just make it easier to achieve.

    Managing UGC for your brand
  </h3>
  <p>Whilst the core strategy for Flockrush allows you to build new audiences around resonating topics, the same tools work in exactly the same way for existing brand audiences. The same powerful tools can surface what your customers and fans are saying about
      your brand and allow your brand to access what could be a rich vein of content to re-publish on your brand social pages. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="-how-flockrush-keeps-your-brand-safe-with-ugc-rights-authorization-"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#-how-flockrush-keeps-your-brand-safe-with-ugc-rights-authorization-"><span></span></a>
    How Flockrush keeps your brand safe with UGC rights authorization
  </h3>
  <p>One word of caution though, using UGC as base content isn &apos;t quite something for nothing - you need to have the approval of the owner of the content to ensure there are no copyright issues. Without this, content owners&apos; complaints can lead to your social
      pages being removed in extreme cases. Flockrush solves this with a single click to request usage authorization, and a #hashtag from the owner to approve it giving you a paper-trail of authorisation. </p>
