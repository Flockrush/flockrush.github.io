      How Flockrush uses content queues to get your fan pages noticed
    </h2>
  <p>Content queues are the unsung heroes of social publishing. A content queue is a collection of posts waiting to be published. Each queue has a defined schedule, publishing posts on social channels in turn instead of publishers having to manage posting
      schedules for individual posts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Flockrush strategy can lead to you posting hourly – 24 times a day, 365 days a year multiplied by the channels you want to post to. Thanks to the way Flockrush manages content queues the efficiency of how you publish and manage content underpins
      how you can use content to build an audience of a million fans.
    </p>
  <p>Using Flockrush content queues to:
      </p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Automate all you publishing, from day one</li><li>
          Manage out under=performing content</li><li>
          Get more out of your best content</li><li>
          Reduce the amount of time your spend creating and managing content</li></ul>
  <p>Before you start setting your queue(s) it’s important to understand the role they play and how they can help you. You will then be able to decide the best strategy for managing your content before you start and let them support you to build your
        first million page fans.
        </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">How content queues grow your audience and radically shift your year-round engagement metrics</h3>
  <p>As the social platforms have matured getting your best content in front of your audience organically has become steadily harder.</p>
  <p>
          With more competition for space in content feeds from both organic and paid sources research by
          <a href="https://social.ogilvy.com/facebook-zero-considering-life-after-the-demise-of-organic-reach/">Social at Ogilvy.</a>  and others found that average organic reach for brands on Facebook has steadily fallen to around 2%.</p>
  <p>
          Turn this around – maybe 98% of your audience are unlikely to see the post you’ve just crafted to perfection. Ouch.</p>
  <p>
          Flockrush overcomes and exploits this – firstly by enabling you to discover and curate content
          <a href="/resources/Discovering-content-at-scale-how-to-find-high-performing-content-for-free-using-Flockrush/"> at scale quickly</a>  and secondly by using queues to manage content publishing.</p>
  <p>
          If you achieve 2% reach from your fan page audience per post, by scaling up your publishing you can reach a far higher number each day without filling people’s content feeds sending your 2% reach from posting once a day well into double figures by posting
          many times a day.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Content queues are far more than schedulers</h3>
  <p>As the content in your queues starts to be published to your Flockrush fan page your content queues become powerful content management engines to ensure you make your best content work hard for you.</p>
  <p>
          Maintaining the quality of your content pool is a key factor in your fan page growth success. The better your engagement, the higher your chance of appearing in follower feeds and even having your posts suggested or recommended by the social networks.</p>
  <p>
          In Flockrush you can filter and sort the posts in your queues to quickly see what’s performing, and what’s not. Removing poor performing content is as important as publishing high performing content. The job of ‘pruning’ your content queues is an easy
          but essential part of your content management routine – your content needs to earn its place in your queues!</p>
  <p>
          How can you get more from your best performing posts? A huge benefit of using queues is recycling content – republishing posts more than once. Remembering that any post will typically have limited reach that can again be exploited to allow you to repost
          high performing content without it being seen repeatedly by the same people. Flockrush has allows you to trigger content to be recycled with one click – then the queue will take care of the rest.</p>
  <p>
          To full exploit the potential of content recycling using queues choose and curate your content to give it maximum longevity, known as ‘ever-green’ content. If you want to recycle great content a year or more after it was first posted it needs to remain
          just as relevant. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Use content queues to reduce your workload dramatically</h3>
  <p>Whilst this may sound very simple and logical it leads to incredible efficiency gains. Once you have built up around 10,000 queued and pruned posts – just over a year of hourly publishing – you should be able to rely almost exclusively on content
          recycling to grow your fan page audience. </p>
  <p>
          Think about that for a second – after your first year of audience growth you could continue to grow large numbers of followers using existing content. We built Flockrush to help you get a million followers in under a year based on just 1-2 hours of effort
          per day. After your first year even that figure can drop significantly.</p>
  <p>
          We make content management simple for you because the rewards for managing your content well are clearly high. </p>
  <p>
          Flockrush content queues can hold un-restricted number of posts so it’s possible to have all your content in a single queue for a fan page. Flockrush also allows you to have unlimited numbers of queues, allowing you to use a queue strategy that matches
          how you want to manage your content. </p>
  <p>
          If you want to segment your content into different queues based on source, sub-themes or anything else, you can do that, managing your posting scheduling between queues to avoid clashes.</p>
