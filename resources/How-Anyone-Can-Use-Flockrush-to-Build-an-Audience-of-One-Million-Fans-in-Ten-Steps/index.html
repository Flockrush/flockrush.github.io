  <p>
      Imagine if you could launch a product having already built a potential audience of one million people and hundreds of thousands of email subscribers to market it to - from apps to events to new products having such opportunity can drastically impact the
      success of that product, and every product you want to market&#x2026;</p>
  <p>
      Welcome to Flockrush! This article explains how you can use
      <a href="http://www.flockrush.com/">Flockrush </a>  to build fan page audiences on social networks in excess of a million people in under a year. An audience built with Flockrush is a traffic engine - something any organisation can benefit from to </p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Grow highly targeted website traffic</li><li>Grow segmented email subscription lists</li><li>Grow revenue through advertising </li></ul>
  <p>So whether you want traffic to support building an online business, launching a new product/event, or simply looking to build fan pages you can use to sell advertising space, Flockrush is the leading platform to do this using free content.</p>
  <p>
      Flockrush brings together a suite of tools for marketers to build and market to large, highly targeted audience groups, underpinned by a powerful strategy. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="how-does-flockrush-work"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#how-does-flockrush-work"><span></span></a>How does Flockrush work?</h3>
  <p>Brands spend significant amounts on trying to make their social content engaging to attract fans. - it&#x2019;s hard to do and even harder to do consistently. Flockrush turns this on it&#x2019;s head, starting instead with curated content based on a subject of
      broad interest that engages your target consumers across B2C &amp; B2B, whoever or wherever they are. .</p>
  <p>
      People have enormous interest in so many things, but for brands organic reach is heading only one way - and that&#x2019;s towards zero, as reported by
      <a href="https://social.ogilvy.com/facebook-zero-considering-life-after-the-demise-of-organic-reach/">social@Ogilvy.</a></p>
  <p>
      Flockrush combats this by using a topics of broad interest that appeal to human desires for entertainment, intrigue and education - such as travel, cute pets, stocks or &#x201C;how to&#x201D; hacks - it&#x2019;s far easier to build highly engaged fan page communities, and
      using the Flockrush strategy these audiences are built with target demographics and segmentation, aligned to your brand.</p>
  <p>
      As your fan page grows followers you can turn this into a traffic engine to deliver visitors and subscribers when and where you need them, typically using a blog to funnel high traffic volumes towards marketing campaigns, online stores, app downloads
      - whatever message, product or service you need to sell.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="how-does-flockrush-help-support-my-marketing"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#how-does-flockrush-help-support-my-marketing"><span></span></a>How does Flockrush help support my marketing?</h3>
  <p>Flockrush gives you traffic to support your marketing objectives, whatever they are, and it doesn&#x2019;t matter what your business is whether you develop enterprise software, apps, movies, write books, market events, sell blenders - if you want to build
      and own a large audience Flockrush makes this possible.</p>
  <p>
      Consider a company that making an app. Despite investing in social media and content it has been unable to achieve large fan growth and not achieved high engagement with content about it&#x2019;s product. Using flockrush they can use any topic that will engage
      - even funny pets - a topic that already has high volumes of content readily available that can be easily curated and used, and automatically posted to their Flockrush blog. </p>
  <p>
      In under a year they build a fan page of over a million followers, using $1,000-$2,000 a month grow it with the target profile for app downloaders. Through directing their followers to their Flockrush blog they are able to convert well over 600k subscribers
      to their blog email list. With relatively little investment they now have a marketing platform that they can use to switch on their marketing.</p>
  <p>
      Now imagine how they can exploit this for the launch of other Appa - they are able to market continuously to tens of thousands of consumers a day both online and email lists of trusting subscribers to achieve a very high impact launch at a fraction of
      the marketing budget they&#x2019;d otherwise need. They convert pet lovers into app users through their website thanks to Flockrush.</p>
  <p>
      You can apply this to any business. Imaging launching your app to over a million prospects on day one - and the opportunity to top download charts. Whether you want to promote movies, events, apps - even yourself - being able to promote to over a million
      of your own prospects, day after day, can be a game changer in so many cases.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="do-i-need-specialist-resources-to-use-flockrush"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#do-i-need-specialist-resources-to-use-flockrush"><span></span></a>Do I need specialist resources to use Flockrush?</h3>
  <p>With Flockrush you don&#x2019;t need a team of specialists - because that&#x2019;s how we built it. Flockrush supports you at every step of this process, reducing the time and resources you need to do this - no high cost content creation, no IT support managing
      blog hosting and security, just one platform that supports the full process. In our experience this can be achieved by someone working 2-3 hours a day using Flockrush, a scale of efficiency that hasn&#x2019;t been possible until now.</p>
  <p>
      Imagine what you would do with a million people to switch your marketing on to - launching products or services, hitting seasonal sales targets, making revenue from advertising - whatever your objectives, with Flockrush you can build large audiences that
      can transform how you grow email subscriber lists, drive traffic to your site or promote marketing campaigns.</p>
  <h3 class="ui header" id="so-why-isnt-everyone-doing-this-already"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#so-why-isnt-everyone-doing-this-already"><span></span></a>So why isn&#x2019;t everyone doing this already?</h3>
  <p>Lots of people are, but without Flockrush it typically requires high and ongoing investment in creating content, or using a myriad of different and unconnected non-specialised tools to manage what can be a complex journey for your content. </p>
  <p>
      Flockrush changes all this, allowing you to manage the whole process from end-to-end creating efficiencies an order of magnitude better than other solutions to this.</p>
  <p>
      Using Flockrush doesn&#x2019;t just simplify the journey for your content, we also make it happen more effectively thanks to our focus on making every step of the process uniquely aligned to the needs of audience builders.</p>
  <p>
      Follow our ten-step strategy and begin your journey to your first one million social fans&#x2026;</p>

</div>
  <h3 id="stepone" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepone"><span></span></a>Step One: Decide on a subject for your social pages</h3>
  <p>You can use Flockrush to manage audience building on any topic. Our core strategy is to find a subject that is of interest to the people you want to target. The rise in influencers and micro-influencers has shown that people will follow and engage
      in high numbers if the subject is interesting. The prime objective is building targeted traffic - the subject is simply the vehicle to do that, even if it is unrelated to the reason you want high traffic volumes.</p>
  <p>
      It doesn&#x2019;t matter what business you are in, selling books, launching apps, events - you can use any subject as long as it&#x2019;s of strong interest to your target market and has a source of high impact content.</p>
  <p>
      Once you have the attention of your audience you can then start to develop them into a powerful traffic source &#x2013; but more on that later.</p>
  <p>
      There are broad topic areas which have mass appeal, such as cats, dogs, travel etc. so you can either use something you know to be brand and likely to appeal to high numbers of your target market or you can use tools such as facebook insights to discover
      high interest areas for audiences you already have.</p>
  <p>
      It&#x2019;s important to bear in mind at this point that to grow your audiences takes a LOT of content &#x2013; so it&#x2019;s also worth looking at what content is available before you settle on a subject. Broad subjects with lots of user-generated content available are
      the easiest to work.</p>
  <p>
      Whilst we based Flockrush on existing content, to truly make this work curation is an important process to increase the impact and engagement. To excel at this always helps if whoever is curating content has some level of interest to be able to have a
      positive approach to this. In our experience it works best to create a short list of subjects so you can pick one that appeals to you too. As part of our support program we have webinars and 1:1 working sessions to guide you through topic discovery,
      where you will learn how to experiment and test topics to ensure alignment with your target audience.</p>
  <p>
      Find out more about picking a subject for your social pages here LINK TO THE RESOURCE DEDICATED TO THIS</p>
  <h3 id="steptwo" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#steptwo"><span></span></a>Step Two: Start your content discovery engine</h3>
  <p>Creating content in high volumes can be very costly, and without any guarantee of success. Finding high performance content, and lots of it, is crucial to building pages that experience constant engagement. Consider a page scheduled with hourly posts
      every day &#x2013; a year of audience building will need nearly 9,000 posts so discovering content at scale, and quickly, is baked into Flockrush from the outset. </p>
  <p>
      In Flockrush there are two key engines to find free content you can curate; user-generated content (UGC) and high quality royalty paid images.</p>
  <p>
      Social media is an incredibly rich source of high performance user-generated content &#x2013; but you need to be able to find it. At Flockrush we&#x2019;ve built powerful machine learning based artificial intelligence into how we see content so you get high quality
      images and posts that can easily be adapted for your audience. To make this easy we also have a process for gaining usage rights for UGC &#x2013; you can mind more about that here.</p>
  <p>
      With Flockrush you also get access to a huge database of high quality, royalty paid, images and videos. These can be used commercially with no extra charges and can be modified at will to make them really engage your audience.</p>
  <p>
      Find out more about how Flockrush can find you almost limitless free content here LINK TO THE RESOURCE DEDICATED TO THIS</p>
  <h3 id="stepthree" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepthree"><span></span></a>Step Three: Curate your way to high performance</h3>
  <p>To really stand out when using user-generated content you need to present it in a visually original and entertaining way &#x2013; such adding your own impactful narrative to a video, making a fun meme - anything that takes quality content and makes it a
      great story.</p>
  <p>
      This is where your best work is done, supported by editing tools within Flockrush that enable you to enhance content to make it really perform well. </p>
  <p>
      Image editing is built into Flockrush, so once you have chosen images as the basis for a post you can add filters, features (you need a cat in glasses? No problem!) and text in a variety of ways to suit your style and tone.</p>
  <p>
      When your imagery is looking great your need to introduce it with comments that not only frame the story for maximum appeal and entertainment, but also to encourage engagement. Giving your audience a great reason to like, comment or share will extend
      the reach and improve visibility. </p>
  <p>
      We&#x2019;ve also built in watermarking, so when your posts do get shared far and wide, it will always be able to be credited back to you.</p>
  <p>
      Curation is where you add value &#x2013; and getting this right will have a huge impact on the success of your strategy. It&#x2019;s as much art as science, but once you are publishing content you will quickly learn what works best and how to curate for maximum impact.</p>
  <p>
      Over time you will generate enough content that recycling your best performing content becomes your primary content source - continuing to grow your fan page audience for you. &#x2018;Pruning&#x2019; your content to ensure you reuse the best performing posts is easy - with sorting and filtering for easy content performance management.</p>

  <p>Using UGC is great to quickly create a pool of low cost, high performance content, but with it comes responsibility to get approval to use it to ensure you aren&#x2019;t exposing yourself to copyright claims from content owners. </p>
  <p>
      In extreme cases social networks can remove pages who are found to continually flout copyright, and when using UGC in high volumes this in itself can become highly time consuming to administer. With Flockrush a simple single-click process can request
      usage rights from content sources and authorization can be given just a quickly with a simple hashtag.</p>
  <p>
      Posts can be automatically released for publishing on receipt of authorization without any further involvement from you, so Flockrush really takes the burden out of managing what can be a difficult process.</p>

  <h3 id="stepfive" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepfive"><span></span></a>Step Five: Publish content, then publish it again, and again</h3>
  <p>A key feature of Flockrush to enable publishing at scale is automated scheduling of content queues. Once you add posts to a queue you are ready to push that content to your pages with ease.</p>
  <p>
      Publishing from content queues is as simple as creating a schedule for what days and times (or frequency) to post and letting Flockrush take care of it. Once you have set the rules you only need to be concerned with ensuring your best content gets maximum
      visibility, and any underperforming content is removed.</p>
  <p>
      As social networks have matured the competition for space on follower feeds has become more and more intense, so any one post may only be seen by a single digit percentage of your fans. To counter this, content can be re-posted frequently to increase
      reach without saturating feeds and losing fans.</p>
  <p>
      When you have thousands of posts in a content queue you need to be able to quickly find the content you want to recycle and the content you want to remove. With our fast filtering you can easily manage your complete content pool to ensure your hard work
      is performing at its best.</p>
  <p>
      By republishing your very best content you can improve your post engagement many times over and achieve efficiency that&#x2019;s hard to deliver any other way.</p>

  <h3 id="stepsix" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepsix"><span></span></a>Step Six: Promote your best content to your target market</h3>
  <p>When you start the process of audience building with Flockrush you chose a topic that resonates highly with your target market. So how do you bring in your ideal fans to achieve your overall marketing objectives?</p>
  <p>
      A key component of the strategy is to combine promoted posts with your organic publishing. This achieves three key aims:</p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>Catalysing the growth of your audience through promoting your most engaging content</li><li>
        Ensuring your posts are seen by your target audience through ad targeting</li><li>
        Maintaining the value of your page to social networks as a source of income and engaging paid content</li></ul>
  <p>By boosting your audience this way you can seed your fan-base with the targeting your need and grow in the direction you desire. Our experience indicates a steady ad spend of between $1,000-$2,000 per month should be budgeted, but this stays constant
      even when your audience grows.</p>
  <p>
      Naturally you will experience organic growth from anyone who wants to follow your page, but with good use of post targeting you can influence this greatly and make it possible to reach the people you want to.</p>
  <p>
      This also opens up the possibility of using consumer focused networks, such as Facebook, to target people not just based on their consumer lifestyle but their professional one too &#x2013; read our blog about how to target B2B opportunities through Facebook

  <h3 id="stepseven" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepseven"><span></span></a>Step Seven: Engage your audience
    </h3>
  <p>When you&#x2019;ve successfully posting to your pages you will find the most engaging content will generate lots of comments. Whilst you don&#x2019;t need to acknowledge or reply to every comment, engaging your audience within posts can be a great way to boost
      your post performance.</p>
  <p>
      Flockrush features a dedicated audience engagement feature that allows you to prioritize and manage responses to comments and messages.</p>
  <p>
      Encouraging users to interact will increase the visibility of your posts on follower feeds and make you visible to their followers. Personalized responses with open questions and reasons to like or share posts are a great way to boost engagement and also
      allow you to add further personality to your pages.</p>
  <h3 id="stepeight" class="green"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#stepeight"><span></span></a>Step Eight: Use a blog to gain high volumes of email subscribers, cross-promote your products and monetize your audience</h3>
  <p>The ultimate aim for having a large audience is to turn it into a successful traffic engine that you can use to grow large numbers of email subscribers, cross promote products and monetize your audience. Social networks typically prioritize content
      that builds quality engagement within their platform, but within your strategy you need to be able to use fan engagement to deliver traffic to the place where you want to activate your marketing.</p>
  <p>
      When posting very frequently, such as hourly, it&#x2019;s possible to seed your posting schedule with links to where you want to send traffic &#x2013; such as a blog - and to do this a number of times a day with up to 20% of your posts to build a regular traffic flow.</p>
  <p>
      Why a blog? Having developed highly engaging content around a topic you can credibly take traffic to a blog where the content mirrors your social posts and you can be confident of further engagement. Now traffic is coming to a site you control and you
      can not only monetize that traffic, but also gain high volumes of email subscribers to gain more influence over your future engagement strategy with direct email. </p>
  <p>
      A major feature of Flockrush is a built-in blog platform. Our blog platform is built on the latest JAMstack.org architecture to make sure you gain fast page load speeds and greater security, without any of the hassles of IT or hosting.</p>
  <p>

      will be familiar with.</p>
  <p>
      Even the process of updating your blog content is managed within Flockrush, with blogs existing as an additional posting channel alongside the social networks so there is a seamless and fully integrated approach to publishing that brings efficiency not
      possible by other means.</p>
