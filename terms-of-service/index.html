  <div class="ui left text container">
  <h2 class="ui header">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>Overview. These Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service” or this “Agreement”) govern your access to and use of Flockrush (“Flockrush”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Web sites, services, code, application programming interfaces (“APIs”), software development kits (“SDKs”) and/or software (collectively, the “Services”). Flockrush is sub-brand of Flockrush Inc. and all Flockrush brands, trademarks, logos, characters or service marks are the exclusive property of Flockrush Inc.

</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service limit Flockrush’ liability and obligations to you, grant Flockrush certain rights and allow Flockrush to change, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services. These Terms of Services also provide for certain rights you may grant to others, including visitors to your website and applications. Your access to and use of the Services are expressly conditioned on your compliance with these Terms of Service. Flockrush reserves the right to update and change these Terms of Service from time to time without notice or acceptance by you, so please check this page frequently for updates and changes.</p>
  <p>Description of the Services. The Services are comprised of a suite of proprietary tools and applications that are designed to enable businesses to analyze, review and enhance their web and social media presence, and interact with consumers on their websites on a real-time basis. As described herein, the Services include tools that help you create content from pre-existing social media content, images and other works (collectively, “Created Content”) as well as analytics tools that help you measure your social media presence.</p>
  <p>Binding Nature. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE AND/OR THE SERVICES YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. YOU ARE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SITE OR TO USE THE SERVICES (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR ACCESS OR USE IS INTENDED) IF YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>
  <p>If you accept or agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.</p>
  <p>Other Applicable Terms. Your use of the Services is also subject to the Flockrush Privacy Policy as may be in effect at the time of your use of the Services. Your use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms, conditions, policies and/or agreements applicable to a specific Web site, service, code, API, SDK, software, service level or version. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Service and such additional terms, conditions, policies and/or agreements, the additional terms, conditions, policies and/or agreements will control. For the avoidance of doubt, if there are terms and conditions in these Terms of Service regarding subjects on which the additional terms, conditions, policies and/or agreements are silent, such silence will not constitute a conflict and the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service will control.</p>
  <h2 class="ui header">2. YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
  <p>Authorization. Use of the Services is void where prohibited by law. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (i) all registration information you submit to us is truthful and accurate; (ii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (iii) you are 18 years of age or older; and (iv) your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Flockrush reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, any account in its sole discretion, at any time.</p>
  <p>Types of Accounts. When you sign up, you are immediately granted a “15 Day Free Trial Account” for the Services. During this trial period account holders are allowed access all the features available through the Services and are not charged by Flockrush for the use of the features they access. Flockrush will collect credit card information prior to activating your account, but your credit card will not be charged until the end of the 7 day trial period.  By accepting these terms and conditions, you agree that your credit card will automatically be charged for access to the service at the then current subscription price at the end of the trial period. Flockrush is not required to notify you at the end of the 7 day trial period prior to applying the subscription charge to your credit card.</p>
  <p>Fees and Payments. If you choose to purchase the services, you may pay via the Flockrush website using a valid credit card only.  Other payment terms may be accepted at the discretion of Flockrush in accordance with our pricing policy. All funds are quoted in the currency in which they are displayed or, where no currency is displayed, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. In addition to paying the published price, you are responsible for paying all applicable taxes in connection with the purchase. Flockrush reserves the right to change its pricing policy or the method or manner in which it charges for the Services at any time at its sole discretion without further notice.</p>
  <p>Auto-Renewal/Recurring Billing. Accounts are billed on a monthly recurring basis and charges will automatically be applied at the beginning of each successive monthly period until such time as the subscriber cancels the Account according to the then current Account cancellation policy. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your Account will have recurring payment requirements and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.</p>
  <p>Credentials. Your account will be accessed through a user ID and password that you will create (your “Credentials”). Your Credentials are solely for your use. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Credentials and you are fully and solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Credentials, whether authorized by you or not. It is your responsibility to take adequate precautions with your Credentials and to immediately notify Flockrush of any unauthorized use of your Credentials.</p>
  <p>Term. These Terms of Service, and any posted revision to these Terms of Service, shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain provisions of these Terms of Service survive termination or expiration of your Account. Please see “Survival” below for more information.</p>
  <h2 class="ui header">3. CONTENT</h2>
  <p>Content. The Services include functionality that permits users to post text, images, audiovisual media and other forms of content and intellectual property, including the data, ideas, inventions, designs, patterns and processes in such material (collectively, “Content”) to the Services, which can be used as posted or incorporated into Created Content (as defined below).

Copying and distributing music without purchasing or obtaining the rights to the music may be in breach of various laws. Prior to uploading your own musical Content, you must be sure that you have the permission to use such musical Content in connection with the Services.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, if you want to publish Content that includes images of someone other than yourself, you must get permission from the individuals portrayed in that Content before using it in connection with the Services.</p>

  <p>This means that we have the right to use and distribute your Content and Created Content to other websites and media, serve advertisements in connection with such distribution or otherwise monetize your Content or Created Content and retain all revenues resulting therefrom, and you agree that Flockrush may do any or all of the foregoing.</p>
