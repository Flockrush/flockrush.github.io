        </p>
  <h3>How long does it take to build audiences?</h3>
  <p>
          There is no formula for audience growth – our audience growing strategy is able to deliver million-strong audiences within a year. With our pricing structure our success is tied inextricably to your success so we work every day to find ways to make day-to-day
          maintenance more effective and efficient and shorten the time it takes to grow, without compromising the methods that drive audience quality.
        </p>
  <h3>How much time will it take me?</h3>
  <p>
          What makes Flockrush a game-changer in audience building is the efficiency we bring to each stage of growing your fan base. Once you have set up your social page(s) and are ready to discover content to post we anticipate you should be able to build an
          audience of around a million fans with 1-2 focused hours per day spent finding and scheduling content and managing your content queues. Every audience grows differently and everyone works differently so this can only ever be a guide – what you
          get out is inevitably a factor of the work you put in.
        </p>
  <h3>Can I use Flockrush to build my brand audience?</h3>
  <p>
          You can – the tools we use support the Flockrush audience growth strategy can be used to manage your brand, although how you use them will be slightly different as you will be unlikely to post at the same scale.
        </p>
