      According to
      <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/247614/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">Statista, </a>  the USA and Canada have over 230m monthly active users out of a population of just over 350m people. The people B2Bs want to market to are on Facebook – they’re just being engaged effectively outside the B2C world.
    </p><h3 class="ui header">What are the biggest challenges for B2B content marketers?</h3><p></p> Respondents to the 2016 B2B Content Marketing Report were asked to consider their biggest challenges. By adopting the Flockrush strategy to content marketing of reaching audiences through topics of interest, many of these challenges are negated,
    removing the barriers B2Bs face in finding an effective path to target marketing effectively through Facebook using user-generated content (UGC). If you aren’t familiar with the Flockrush strategy we recommend you find out more

      Using Flockrush you can focus on content curation over content creation. Flockrush tackles the challenge of creating content head on – by offering an approach to use high performing UGC that is easy to discover from a number of sources. </p><p>
      Efficiency is at the core of Flockrush, allowing large targeted audiences to be build with 1-2 hours per day of curating and publishing content. As our strategy uses topics of broad interest the task of discovering and curating content can be managed
      by non-specialist marketers and even outsourced easily. </p><p>
      Read more about why Content Curation Beats Content Creation for audience building (INSERT LINK) to learn how large audiences can be created without draining your resources. With Flockrush, not only is it possible to curate content with limited time, but
      by using zero-cost UGC a lack of budget for producing content – a problem cited by almost a third of respondents – no longer needs to be a challenge.
    </p><h3 id="Notwo" class="ui header">#2 Measuring content effectiveness (42%)</h3><p>
      While measuring the effectiveness of content is the second most cited challenge, this is only half the problem – the other half being what you do when you do once you are able to measure effectiveness.</p><p>
      With Flockrush, content is king – and with such high volumes of posting measuring effectiveness needs to be done at the same scale as your publishing. Every post is monitored and measured systematically and the results accessible either though customizable
      dashboards - using analytics to grow your fan pages (INSERT RESOURCE LINK TO AUDIENCE BUILDING BY NUMBERS) - or in the operation of your content management (LINK TO HOW FLOCKRUSH USES QUEUES TO GET YOUR FAN PAGES NOTICED). This helps you weed out
      underperformers and recycle/promote the content that works for you. Flockrush full integrates your fan pages with a Flockrush blog to ensure you can track effectiveness through to the interaction with your marketing messages.</p><p></p><h3 id="Nothree" class="ui header">#3 Producing truly engaging content (41%)</h3><p>
      Number three on the list of challenges is producing truly engaging content – something that Flockrush helps you to do consistently. When you produce new brand content there is no guarantee it will perform at the level required to satisfy expected ROI.
      Doing this consistently takes committed resources which few B2B content marketing teams get right. </p><p>
      Flockrush allows you to see the performance of UCG in the discovery phase, meaning you can sift out the content that is proven to engage time after time. Where you need rights approval to use content we have a built-in workflow that manages this for you
      with a single click. </p><p>
      Because you are engaging your target market through a topic you know they are interested in the way you engage them, at scale, is a far easier task than having to convince potential customers to interact with your marketing content directly.
    </p><h3 id="Nofour" class="ui header">#4 Producing enough content variety/volume (39%)</h3><p>
      Flockrush was built for scale. For most brands posting good content even on a daily basis is a challenge. With our strategy and platform you are able to do this hourly and still achieve higher levels of engagement per post.</p><p>
      You don’t have to have a wide variety of content – the themes you build fan-pages around require a level of consistency – but as long as you have researched how to choose a topic to build a fan page (LINK TO SPECIFIC RESOURCE) you will be able to find
      plenty of content to support high levels of fan page growth.
    </p><h3 id="Nofive" class="ui header">#5 Getting content delivered to the right audience (32%)</h3><p>
      Within Flockrush you can target your audience in two ways. Firstly you support your organic post reach with a limited amount of paid post promotion that very tightly targets your preferred audience, seeding your fan page with the followers you want. As
      your followers grow they will produce high volumes of traffic to your blog page where you can direct them to where you want them to go.</p><p>
      You will also promote posts that link to your Flockrush blog (LINK TO WHY YOUR FAN PAGE AUDIENCE NEEDS A FLOCKRUSH BLOG) allowing you to deliver high volumes of traffic to a page you control and can present your message with far greater visibility than
      traditional online ads. </p><p>
      Flockrush offers B2Bs a very different approach to content marketing and understanding the strategy behind Flockrush fan page building is an essential step to understanding how you can overcome these big challenges that a large number of organisations
      encounter. What you can then discover is that by changing the rules of the game it’s possible to open up routes to customers through Facebook that are under-utilized by B2B organisations.</p><p>
