  <h2>Flockrush Strategy Guide: How to choose a topic to build a fan page
    </h2>
  <p>Flockrush can be used to build fan pages for
      <i>any topic whatsoever</i>.</p>
  <p>The Flockrush strategy is to start with a defined target consumer group and then find a topic that corresponds a strong interest of theirs. Facebook Audience Insights (
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights">https://www.facebook.com/ads/audience-insights/</a>
      ) gives you a wealth of insights in to the interests of demographic profiles you can select.
    </p>
  <p><img alt="uncover Facebook topic ideas" src="/img/resources/Posts/uncover-facebook-topic-ideas.png"></p>
  <p>So here's how you can use this to uncover ideas on topics for your fan pages. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">Filter with your target audience, but without being too restrictive.
    </h3>
  <p>You are looking for topics that are of interest to millions of people – if you search too narrowly you will by default restrict yourself to very niche subjects that won’t have the opportunity to grow a big fan base. </p>
  <p>Stick to what is essential for your objectives – for example if you are wanting to generate traffic for a site that only sells in North America than restrict your search to that audience (it’s big enough!) but when you add any filters
      always look at how much that restricts the pool of people you are left. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><img alt="Filter Facebook Audiences" src="img/filter-facebook-audiences.png"></p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Look at the categories and pages that are most aligned to that group profile &nbsp;
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>From the ‘Page Likes’ tab you can see the pages most liked by this group, how many of the group like the pages and the total number of fans those pages have. You want to exclude organisations and celebrities from your consideration –
      you are looking for a topic you can curate a lot of content on that isn’t owned by someone else. </p>
  <p><img alt="Facebook categories and pages" src="img/facebook-categories-and-pages.png"></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You are also looking for fan pages relevant to this group that have a high number of fans. If you want to target building a fan page with over a million followers targeting this group, then there needs to be an existing interest area that has the
      scope for a large audience. </p>
  <p>You are looking for pages with many millions of followers, and a high volume of those from this group, ideally millions. Facebook ranks relevance, shows the total Facebook following for the page and the number of followers from your demographic selection.
      </p>
  <p><img alt="Facebook traffic opportunities" src="img/facebook-traffic-opportunities.png" title=""></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This can give you a quick reference to see where the traffic opportunities lie. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Look at pages already serving potential topics
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>Look at any topic pages listed for that audience and look at: </p>
  <ul class="ui list p-light-up"><li>How many followers do they have? Is it millions? </li><li>How frequently are they posting? Is it daily? </li><li>What engagement are they achieving per fan per post? </li></ul>
  <p>For existing pages on those topics look at what is performing well, and getting high levels of engagement per post from a large audience. Pages can hold very large but less engaged audiences, or smaller audiences with higher engagement rates. </p>
  <p>Ultimately there isn't a right or wrong answer to what is best, but you need to be able to achieve a level of conversion that to achieve your objectives (such as driving website traffic, getting email subscriptions via a blog or monetizing your blog
      traffic). </p>
  <p>From the pages you discover via Facebook Audience Insights you can find similar pages and extend your research. Look broadly to give you a wide whether there is enough clear interest to support you and your fan page. </p>
  <p>For the most follower page build a picture of how frequently they are posting, what they are posting and how well they are performing. This is a key tool for learning how you can start your strategy learning from the experiences of others. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Consider all your options
    </h3>
  <p>Your hunt may offer you a number of topics to consider. Look at the options that have the performance potential and review them against: </p>
  <div class="ui ordered list p-light-up">
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">
  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">Is there a good source of content for this topic</a>
  <div class="description">Look in Flockrush content discovery to see what UGC and royalty paid images are there.</div>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="item space-notchem-bottom">
  <div class="content">
  <a class="header space-notchem-bottom">How much interest you have in the topic</a>
  <div class="description">Where you have a number of curators and a number of topics it’s always best to match people to the topics that most engage them so they will be able to curate the best content.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
  <p></p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Working backwards - validating your ideas
    </h3>
  <p>You can flip this process on its head, looking at a topic you know is highlight engaging, and then see who you can target with it. If your objective is to build a large fan page audience but without defined targeting then you can work with topics
      and find your audience. Remember you will need to target people with some paid advertising, so if you start with a topic you then need to use insights to discover the market that they appeal to so you are able still able to target them. </p>
  <h3 class="ui header">
      Test Your Ideas
    </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>There are rich sources of data to support your decision making, with Facebook Audience Insights being possibly the most valuable, but until you start executing your strategy you won’t be sure of the results. Because of the highly efficient way
      Flockrush helps you rapidly build content for your pages it makes it much easier to test concepts to find out if you have a good topic for you fan page. </p>
  <p>The first days and weeks of your strategy execution are very telling for how your page will perform so time invested to evaluate your approach is time well spent. </p>
  <p></p>
